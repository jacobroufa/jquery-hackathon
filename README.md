> You need the TSV text file data dumps to do the import...
> Get that and change a couple filenames if necessary and things should work fine!

Donâ€™t forget to `bower install` and `composer install` in the relevant directories.

Gunzip the database dump (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14528425/access_log_201409101900.txt.gz) in the import folder before running the import script.

The import script will create a sql file that you can then import into the database.
